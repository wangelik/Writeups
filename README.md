# Challenge Writeups

This repository contains writeups of interesting security-, math- or IT-related challenges, wargames, and CTFs.   
The topics will mainly cover:
* `cryptography`
* `steganography & forensics` 
* `binary exploitation`
* `machine learning`
* `logic`
* `reverse engineering`
* `web security`
* `networking`

## Structure

The writeups are contained in separate folders with names of the format `year-month-[name of challenge event]`.   
Note, that not all challenges per event do have a writeup. I try to particularly select a variety of interesting topics and difficulties.
